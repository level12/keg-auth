Triage
------

Initial Release
---------------
- circleci
- CI should test PostgreSQL instead of SQLite?
- Document removal of cleanup function for: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/301
- Need user CRUD workflow.
  - When new user is created, we need them to verify their account.  This could be how we get
  their password too, use a rebranded password view.


For Agari
---------
- invalidate an existing token if the user logs in?
- document testing and development options, readme
- support password complexity?
- Login page: redirect if user is logged in?
- Add token expiration time to reset email.
- Should we be using the check-manifest command in tox.ini?


Backlog
-------
- review authbwc functionality and duplicate good parts
- rate limiting and audit trail
- test Login form next redirection, make sure it's secure
- Flask login has some options when logging a user in for "remember" and "fresh" should we use them?
- Flask login has some enhanced security for preventing session hijacking, use it?
- cli command to add user, how does this integrate as an extension?
- csrf cleanup should go in keg_elements?


Icebox
-------
- keg BaseView could have a .flashes() that saves flashes and makes them easier to work with
- keg BaseView could be reworked so that we don't need to subclass in make_blueprint()
- how does keg BaseView let us add multiple entry points to a single view?
- add signals
- Consider config setting to prevent user enumeration:

    - https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-god-login/
    - hashing password even for non-users
- login by email, send easy-login link like Slack
- social account registration and login
- bcrypt probably doesn't need to be a hardcoded setup.py requirement
- have another test in tox to run with default crypto to make sure it's setup and working
  correctly for our non-test defaults
- invalid data in the password field will throw an exception.  Catch this?
- bootstrap tamplate: why do the form fields show up not as indented as paragraph and headings?
- Render all view messages from templates so language can be easily overridden without subclassing?
- UserMixin should be generated from a function?
- 2FA
- text message to reset password link
- Where should reset-password.html cancel link go?  Is Login right?
- forms aren't tested thoroughly/separately, e.g. field validations
- When token is invalid, we redirect to forgot-password with a flash.  That's a little jaring from
  a UX perspective.
- If a token exists and is not expired, don't generate a new one, as a malicious user could keep
  requesting token resets.  Maybe a mute point of we get rate limiting setup.
