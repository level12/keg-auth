- circleci
- keg BaseView could have a .flashes() that saves flashes and makes them easier to work with
- Document removal of cleanup function for: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/301
- keg BaseView could be reworked so that we don't need to subclass in make_blueprint()
- how does keg BaseView let us add multiple entry points?
- mimic authbwc functionality
- add signals
- Evaluate risk of user enumeration:
    - https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/158075/is-it-unsafe-to-show-message-that-username-account-does-not-exist-at-login
    - https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-god-login/
- rate limiting
- hashing password even for non-users
- is_active needs to take into account email validation and disabled accounts
- login by email
- social account registration and login
- bcrypt probably doesn't need to be a hardcoded setup.py requirement
- have another test in tox to run with default crypto to make sure it's setup and working
  correctly for our non-test defaults
- test Login form next redirection, make sure it's secure
- Flask login has some options when logging a user in for "remember" and "fresh" should we use them?
- Flask login has some enhanced security for preventing session hijacking, use it?
- document testing and development
- CI should test PostgreSQL instead of SQLite?
- cli command to add user, how does this integrate as an extension?
- email support
- invalid data in the password field will throw an exception.  Catch this?
- why do the form fields show up not as indented as paragraph and headings?
- Should AuthFormView be a mixin?
- Render all messages from templates so language can be easily overridden without subclassing?
- At one point, I wanted to conditionally render templates but didn't want to figure out how to
  do that.  Turns out `render_template()` will take a list of templates and render the first that
  is found.
- Force login after password change: enforce password just picked, give user explicit confirmation
  that they are logged in.
- UserMixin should be generated from a function?
- 2FA
- text message to reset password link
- maybe "kegauth" in templates should be "auth_manager" instead since that is what we use i.e.
  app.auth_manager
- invalidate an existing token if the user logs in
